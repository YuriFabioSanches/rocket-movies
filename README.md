<h2 id="project">📁 Project</h2>

This project is a web application designed for managing user-created movie notes. The application allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for both users and movie notes. Developed with the frontend in React.js and the backend in Node.js, the project offers a complete and integrated platform for users to record their cinematic experiences.

<h2 id="project">🗝️ Key Features</h2>

- ✔️ User Management: Users can register in the application, log in, update their profile information, and if necessary, delete their accounts. The authentication system ensures that each user only has access to their own notes and personal data.

- ✔️ Movie Notes CRUD: Users can create notes for the movies they have watched, providing details such as movie title, note description, rating, and tags. Movie notes are linked to the user who created them, allowing each user to have their own record of reviews and comments on the movies they've watched.

- ✔️ Frontend and Backend Integration: The frontend, developed in React.js, interacts efficiently with the backend in Node.js through HTTP requests. This allows for a smooth and responsive user experience, with real-time updates and secure communication between the frontend and backend layers of the application.
